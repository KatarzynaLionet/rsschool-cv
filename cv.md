### Briefly About Me
 I have good experience in medicine and always keep thinking about optimization of millions science researching with machine to get new discoveries for improving healthcare system. Also I feel some kind of boring doing routine procedures everyday in my working hours without creating something new and useful. So this is how I started to get interested in Frontend Development.
 My core strength are problem solving and fast learning help me to keep going on and on to become proficient developers.
 I want to get knowledges and skills that will be enough to become Data Scientist on medical projects one day.
