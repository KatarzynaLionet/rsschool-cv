### Briefly About Me
 I have good experience in medicine and always keep thinking about optimization of millions science researching with machine to get new discoveries for improving healthcare system. Also I feel some kind of boring doing routine procedures everyday in my working hours without creating something new and useful. So this is how I started to get interested in Frontend Development.
 My core strength are problem solving and fast learning help me to keep going on and on to become proficient developers.
 I want to get knowledges and skills that will be enough to become Data Scientist on medical projects one day.
### Skills
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code
### Code Examples
Task.
*Write a program that receives three numerals, one number per line, and outputs to the console in three lines first the maximum, then the minimum, then the remaining number.*

My solution made with Python:
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if b <= a >= c:
    print (a) 
    if a >= c and c > b:
        print (b)
        print (c)
    else:
        print (c)
        print (b)
elif a <= b >= c:
    print (b)
    if b >= a and a > c:
        print (c)
        print (a)
    else:
        print (a)
        print (c)
elif a <= c >= b:
    print (c)
    if c >= a and b > a:
        print (a)
        print (b)
    else:
        print (b)
        print (a)
